            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Our Story--
                Wave Wonder Rafting started right here in Texas in 2012, when a group of friends with a passion for the
                outdoors decided
                the Lone Star State needed a rafting experience as bold as its spirit. With just a couple of rafts and a
                whole lot of
                determination, they set out to share the rush of whitewater with anyone ready to grab a paddle.
                What began as weekend adventures on Texas rivers quickly grew into a full-blown rafting company known
                for big splashes,
                big laughs, and even bigger memories. Over the years, weâ€™ve guided thousands of paddlersâ€”families,
                thrill-seekers, and
                first-timers alikeâ€”helping them discover the joy of teamwork, the thrill of rapids, and the beauty of
                Texas from the
                water.
                Today, Wave Wonder Rafting is proud to be one of Texasâ€™s favorite river outfitters, bringing adventure,
                safety, and a
                whole lot of fun to every trip. Because around here, the river isnâ€™t just waterâ€”itâ€™s where the adventure
                begins. ðŸŒŠ</p>

        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Maribel Ramirez and I am from Edinburg, Texas. I have a backgorund in mergers and
            aquisitions for a private bank
            that I worked for in the past six years which I really enjoyed while I was there. I am looking to expand
            both professionally and spiritually which
            seems to be happening for me right now hence the current course. I want to grow and be of service to others
            in any way they need and I know that by
            growing my own skills I will be better equiped to do so.

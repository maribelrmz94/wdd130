            <p> Hello everyone! My name is Maribel Ramirez and I am from Edinburg, Texas. I have a backgorund in mergers
                and
                aquisitions for a private bank
                that I worked for in the past six years which I really enjoyed while I was there. I am looking to expand
                both professionally and spiritually which
                seems to be happening for me right now hence the current course. I want to grow and be of service to
                others
                in any way they need and I know that by
                growing my own skills I will be better equiped to do so.

            </p>
